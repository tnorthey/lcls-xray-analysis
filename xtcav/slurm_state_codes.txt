BF BOOT_FAIL
    Job terminated due to launch failure, typically due to a hardware failure (e.g. unable to boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued). 

CA CANCELLED
    Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator. The job may or may not have been initiated. 

CD COMPLETED
    Job has terminated all processes on all nodes with an exit code of zero. 

CF CONFIGURING
    Job has been allocated resources, but are waiting for them to become ready for use (e.g. booting). 

CG COMPLETING
    Job is in the process of completing. Some processes on some nodes may still be active. 

DL DEADLINE
    Job terminated on deadline. 

F FAILED
    Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other failure condition. 

NF NODE_FAIL
    Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes. 

OOM OUT_OF_MEMORY

RQ REQUEUED

RV REVOKED

SI SIGNALING

SE SPECIAL_EXIT
